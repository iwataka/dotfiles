# My Vim Configuration

## Philosophy

### Cross-Platform

I use Windows frequently as well as other Unix-based OS, so it is required that Vim performs well even on Windows.
Windows is slow compared with other OS, so Vim must be as simple as possible.
Unused plug-ins and settings should be removed and I utilize lazy loading by vim-plug to speed up start-up time.

### Writing-Purpose

I use Vim for writing plain-texts as well as for coding and some of the features are for it

### Vim is not just a text editor but a rich user interface

I use Vim to manipulate google-calendar and so on.

### Consistent and Intuitive

Mappings should give same functions even in other filetype.
